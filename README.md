# ABAP Practice Repository 

This repository contains a collection of ABAP programs that I have practiced.

## Programs

1. **Program 1 - Arithmetic Operations:**
   
- Program Overview:
This ABAP program, named ABAP_Prog1, performs basic arithmetic operations on three variables (x, y, and z).


2. **Program 2 - Arithmetic Operations with Selection Screen and Radio Buttons:**

- Program Overview:
The ABAP program ABAP_Prog2 allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input through a selection screen.


3. **Program 3 - Arithmetic Operations with Color Formatting:**

- Program Overview:
The ABAP program ABAP_Prog3 takes two numeric input parameters (P_X and P_Y) and a string parameter (P_str). It then calculates the sum of the numeric parameters and displays the result. Additionally, it outputs information about the entered string, current date, time, and user.

4. **Program 4 - Arithmetic Operations with Selection of Check Boxes:**

- Program Overview:
-The ABAP program ABAP_Prog4 allows users to perform arithmetic operations based on selected checkboxes. It takes two obligatory numeric parameters (p_x and p_y) and has two checkboxes (PC1 and PC2) for addition and subtraction operations.

5. **Program 5 - Arithmetic Operations with Selection of Pushbuttons:**

- Program Overview:
-The ABAP program ABAP_Prog5 provides a user interface with parameters for numeric input (p_x and p_y) and three push buttons (B1, B2, and B3) with user commands (fc1, fc2, and fc3). The program allows users to perform addition, clear input fields, or exit the program.
