# ABAP Practice Repository 

This repository contains a collection of ABAP programs that I have practiced.

## Programs

1. **Program 1:**
-Description:
- Program Overview:
-This ABAP program, named ABAP_Prog1, performs basic arithmetic operations on three variables (x, y, and z).
-Variable Declaration:

-Three variables, x, y, and z, are declared using the DATA statement.
-Initialization:

-The program initializes the variable x with the value 10.
-Arithmetic Operation:

-Variable y is assigned the value 20.
-The program adds the values of x and y and stores the result in variable z.
-Display Result:

-The result of the addition (z) is displayed using the WRITE statement.
-Formatted Output:

-The program demonstrates different formatting options for displaying the result.
-The result is displayed left-justified using WRITE : / 'Addition of two numbers is', z LEFT-JUSTIFIED.
-The result is displayed centered using WRITE : / 'Addition of two numbers is', z CENTERED.
-This program essentially adds two numbers (x and y) and showcases different ways to present the result using the WRITE statement with formatting options.
